Year - breeding season for which guano area/colony size correlation is estimated.
Colony_size_chicks - size of colony in n of chicks, as provided by MAPPPD studies. Please find the colony size in MAPPPD: https://www.penguinmap.com
Min_area - minimum non-zero visible-band guano area throughout the year, summed with error estimations (sqm)
Min_area_no_err - minimum non-zero visible-band guano area throughout the year, without summing error estimations (sqm)
Avg_area and avg_area_no_err - the average guano area throughout the year in visible band, with and without error summations.
Max_area and max_area_no_err - the maximum guano area throughout the year in visible band, with and without error summations.
Avg_cluster_area_with_err - average guano area if only stable guano patches (clusters/non-diffuse guano patches) are included, measured from visible-band calculations, and summed with corresponding error measures.
Avg_cluster_area_no_err - average guano area if only stable guano patches (clusters/non-diffuse guano patches) are included, measured from visible-band calculations, but without corresponding error measures summed.
Observations - n of individual observations (images) for the given year.
